{"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science": "field of study to extract knowledge from data not to be confused with information science or computer science the existence of comet neowise here depicted as a series of red dots was discovered by analyzing astronomical survey data acquired by a space telescope the wide field infrared survey explorer data science is an interdisciplinary academic field 1 that uses statistics scientific computing scientific methods processing scientific visualization algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge from potentially noisy structured or unstructured data 2 data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain e g natural sciences information technology and medicine 3 data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science a research paradigm a research method a discipline a workflow and a profession 4 data science is a concept to unify statistics data analysis informatics and their related methods to understand and analyze actual phenomena with data 5 it uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics statistics computer science information science and domain knowledge 6 however data science is different from computer science and information science turing award winner jim gray imagined data science as a fourth paradigm of science empirical theoretical computational and now data driven and asserted that everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology and the data deluge 7 8 data science is often described as a multidisciplinary field because it draws on techniques from diverse areas such as computer science statistics information science and other subject specific disciplines some researchers say that the combination of the different fields is similar to how information science was decades ago mayernik 2023 these similarities help us understand how data science became its own field of study 9 a data scientist is a professional who creates programming code and combines it with statistical knowledge to summarize data 10 foundations edit data science is an interdisciplinary field 11 focused on extracting knowledge from typically large data sets and applying the knowledge from that data to solve problems in other application domains the field encompasses preparing data for analysis formulating data science problems analyzing data and summarizing these findings as such it incorporates skills from computer science mathematics data visualization graphic design communication and business 12 vasant dhar writes that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description in contrast data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data e g from images text sensors transactions customer information etc and emphasizes prediction and action 13 andrew gelman of columbia university has described statistics as a non essential part of data science 14 stanford professor david donoho writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data science program he describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics 15 etymology edit early usage edit in 1962 john tukey described a field he called data analysis which resembles modern data science 15 in 1985 in a lecture given to the chinese academy of sciences in beijing c f jeff wu used the term data science for the first time as an alternative name for statistics 16 later attendees at a 1992 statistics symposium at the university of montpellier ii acknowledged the emergence of a new discipline focused on data of various origins and forms combining established concepts and principles of statistics and data analysis with computing 17 18 the term data science has been traced back to 1974 when peter naur proposed it as an alternative name to computer science in his 1974 book concise survey of computer methods peter naur proposed using the term data science rather than computer science to reflect the growing emphasis on data driven methods 19 6 in 1996 the international federation of classification societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic 6 however the definition was still in flux after the 1985 lecture at the chinese academy of sciences in beijing in 1997 c f jeff wu again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science he reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data 20 in 1998 hayashi chikio argued for data science as a new interdisciplinary concept with three aspects data design collection and analysis 18 modern usage edit in 2012 technologists thomas h davenport and dj patil declared data scientist the sexiest job of the 21st century 21 a catchphrase that was picked up even by major city newspapers like the new york times 22 and the boston globe 23 a decade later they reaffirmed it stating that the job is more in demand than ever with employers 24 the modern conception of data science as an independent discipline is sometimes attributed to william s cleveland 25 in 2014 the american statistical association s section on statistical learning and data mining changed its name to the section on statistical learning and data science reflecting the ascendant popularity of data science 26 over the last few years many colleges have begun to create more structured undergraduate programs in data science according to a report by the national academies strong programs typically include training in statistics computing ethics and communication as well as hands on work in a specific field national academies of sciences engineering and medicine 2018 as schools try to prepare students for jobs that use data these practices become more common 27 the professional title of data scientist has been attributed to dj patil and jeff hammerbacher in 2008 28 though it was used by the national science board in their 2005 report long lived digital data collections enabling research and education in the 21st century it referred broadly to any key role in managing a digital data collection 29 data science and data analysis edit example of exploratory data analysis using the datasaurus dozen data set in data science data analysis is the process of inspecting cleaning transforming and modelling data to discover useful information draw conclusions and support decision making 30 it includes exploratory data analysis eda which uses graphics and descriptive statistics to explore patterns and generate hypotheses 31 and confirmatory data analysis which applies statistical inference to test hypotheses and quantify uncertainty 32 typical activities comprise data collection and integration data cleaning and preparation handling missing values outliers encoding normalisation feature engineering and selection visualisation and descriptive statistics 31 fitting and evaluating statistical or machine learning models 32 communicating results and ensuring reproducibility e g reports notebooks and dashboards 33 lifecycle frameworks such as crisp dm describe these steps from business understanding through deployment and monitoring 34 data science involves working with larger datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze data scientists often work with unstructured data such as text or images and use machine learning algorithms to build predictive models data science often uses statistical analysis data preprocessing and supervised learning 35 36 recent studies indicate that ai is moving towards data centric approaches focusing on the quality of datasets rather than just improving ai models this trend focuses on improving system performance by cleaning refining and labeling data bhatt et al 2024 as ai systems grow larger the data centric view has become increasingly important 37 cloud computing for data science edit a cloud based architecture for enabling big data analytics data flows from various sources such as personal computers laptops and smart phones through cloud services for processing and analysis finally leading to various big data applications cloud computing can offer access to large amounts of computational power and storage 38 in big data where volumes of information are continually generated and processed these platforms can be used to handle complex and resource intensive analytical tasks 39 some distributed computing frameworks are designed to handle big data workloads these frameworks can enable data scientists to process and analyze large datasets in parallel which can reduce processing times 40 ethical consideration in data science edit data science involves collecting processing and analyzing data which often includes personal and sensitive information ethical concerns include potential privacy violations bias perpetuation and negative societal impacts 41 42 ethics education in data science has grown to encompass both technical principles and more expansive philosophical questions research indicates that data science ethics courses are increasingly integrating human centric topics including fairness accountability and responsible decision making thereby connecting them to enduring discussions in moral and political philosophy colando hardin 2024 the goal of this method is to help students understand how data driven technologies affect society 43 machine learning models can amplify existing biases present in training data leading to discriminatory or unfair outcomes 44 45 another area of data science that is growing is the push for better ways to cite data citing datasets makes it easier for other researchers to understand what data was used and for studies to be repeated lafia et al 2023 these practices give the people who collect and manage data the credit they deserve which is becoming more important in modern research 46 see also edit wikibooks has a book

with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalise to unseen data and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions 1 within a subdiscipline in machine learning advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks a class of statistical algorithms to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance ml finds application in many fields including natural language processing computer vision speech recognition email filtering agriculture and medicine the application of ml to business problems is known as predictive analytics statistics and mathematical optimisation mathematical programming methods comprise the foundations of machine learning data mining is a related field of study focusing on exploratory data analysis eda through unsupervised learning 3 4 from a theoretical viewpoint probably approximately correct learning provides a mathematical and statistical framework for describing machine learning most traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be described as empirical risk minimisation under this framework history edit see also timeline of machine learning the term machine learning was coined in 1959 by arthur samuel an ibm employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence 5 6 the synonym self teaching computers was also used during this time period 7 8 the earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s when arthur samuel invented a computer program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side but the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes 9 in 1949 canadian psychologist donald hebb published the book the organization of behavior in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells 10 hebb s model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how ais and machine learning algorithms work under nodes or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data 9 other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well including logician walter pitts and warren mcculloch who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes 9 by the early 1960s an experimental learning machine with punched tape memory called cybertron had been developed by raytheon company to analyse sonar signals electrocardiograms and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning it was repetitively trained by a human operator teacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a goof button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions 11 a representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was nils nilsson s book on learning machines dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification 12 interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s as described by duda and hart in 1973 13 in 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognise 40 characters 26 letters 10 digits and 4 special symbols from a computer terminal 14 tom m mitchell provided a widely quoted more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field a computer program is said to learn from experience e with respect to some class of tasks t and performance measure p if its performance at tasks in t as measured by p improves with experience e 15 this definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms this follows alan turing s proposal in his paper computing machinery and intelligence in which the question can machines think is replaced with the question can machines do what we as thinking entities can do 16 modern day machine learning algorithms are broken into 3 algorithm types supervised learning algorithms unsupervised learning algorithms and reinforcement learning algorithms 17 current supervised learning algorithms have objectives of classification and regression current unsupervised learning algorithms have objectives of clustering dimensionality reduction and association rule current reinforcement learning algorithms focus on decisions that must be made with respect to some previous unknown time and are broken down to either be studies of model based methods or model free methods in 2014 ian goodfellow and others introduced generative adversarial networks gans with realistic data synthesis 18 by 2016 alphago obtained victory against top human players using reinforcement learning techniques 19 relationships to other fields edit artificial intelligence edit deep learning is a subset of machine learning which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence 20 as a scientific endeavour machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence ai in the early days of ai as an academic discipline some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data they attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods as well as what were then termed neural networks these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalised linear models of statistics 21 probabilistic reasoning was also employed especially in automated medical diagnosis 22 488 however an increasing emphasis on the logical knowledge based approach caused a rift between ai and machine learning probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation 22 488 by 1980 expert systems had come to dominate ai and statistics was out of favour 23 work on symbolic knowledge based learning did continue within ai leading to inductive logic programming ilp but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of ai proper in pattern recognition and information retrieval 22 708 710 755 neural networks research had been abandoned by ai and computer science around the same time this line too was continued outside the ai cs field as connectionism by researchers from other disciplines including john hopfield david rumelhart and geoffrey hinton their main success came in the mid 1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation 22 25 machine learning ml reorganised and recognised as its own field started to flourish in the 1990s the field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature it shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from ai and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics fuzzy logic and probability theory 23 data compression edit this section is an excerpt from data compression machine learning edit there is a close connection between machine learning and compression a system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution conversely an optimal compressor can be used for prediction by finding the symbol that compresses best given the previous history this equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for general intelligence 24 25 26 an alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors and compression based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces for each compressor c we define an associated vector space such that c maps an input string x corresponding to the vector norm x an exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space instead feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods lzw lz77 and ppm 27 according to aixi theory a connection more directly explained in hutter prize the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x for example in that model a zip file s compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software since you can not unzip it without both but there may be an even smaller combined form examples of ai powered audio video compression software include nvidia maxine aivc 28 examples of software that can perform ai powered image compression include opencv tensorflow matlab s image processing toolbox ipt and high fidelity generative image compression 29 in unsupervised machine learning k means clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters this technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression 30 data compression aims to reduce the size of data files enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission k means clustering an unsupervised machine learning algorithm is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters k each represented by the centroid of its points this process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points particularly beneficial in image and signal processing k means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space 31 large language models llms are also efficient lossless data compressors on some data sets as demonstrated by deepmind s research with the chinchilla 70b model developed by deepmind chinchilla 70b effectively compressed data outperforming conventional methods such as portable network graphics png for images and free lossless audio codec flac for audio it achieved compression of image and audio data to 43 4 and 16 4 of their original sizes respectively there is however some reason to be concerned that the data set used for testing overlaps the llm training data set making it possible that the chinchilla 70b model is only an efficient compression tool on data it has already been trained on 32 33 data mining edit machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly but while machine learning focuses on prediction based on known properties learned from the training data data mining focuses on the discovery of previously unknown properties in the data this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases data mining uses many machine learning methods but with different goals on the other hand machine learning also employs data mining methods as unsupervised learning or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy much of the confusion between these two research communities which do often have separate conferences and separate journals ecml pkdd being a major exception comes from the basic assumptions they work with in machine learning performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge while in knowledge discovery and data mining kdd the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge evaluated with respect to known knowledge an uninformed unsupervised method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods while in a typical kdd task supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data citation needed machine learning also has intimate ties to optimisation many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of some loss function on a training set of examples loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances for example in classification one wants to assign a label to instances and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples 34 generalization edit characterizing the generalisation of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research especially for deep learning algorithms statistics edit machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods but distinct in their principal goal statistics draws population inferences from a sample while machine learning finds generalisable predictive patterns 35 conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set in addition only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis in contrast machine learning is not built on a pre structured model rather the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns the more variables input used to train the model the more accurate the ultimate model will be 36 leo breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms data model and algorithmic model 37 wherein algorithmic model means more or less the machine learning algorithms like random forest some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning 38 statistical physics edit analytical and computational techniques derived from deep rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large scale problems including machine learning e g to analyse the weight space of deep neural networks 39 statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics 40 theory edit main articles computational learning theory and statistical learning theory a core objective of a learner is to generalise from its experience 2 41 generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new unseen examples tasks after having experienced a learning data set the training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution considered representative of the space of occurrences and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases the computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning model because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms instead probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common the bias variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalisation error for the best performance in the context of generalisation the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data if the hypothesis is less complex than the function then the model has underfitted the data if the complexity of the model is increased in response then the training error decreases but if the hypothesis is too complex then the model is subject to overfitting and generalisation will be poorer 42 in addition to performance bounds learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning in computational learning theory a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time there are two kinds of time complexity results positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time approaches edit in supervised learning the training data is labelled with the expected answers while in unsupervised learning the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories which correspond to learning paradigms depending on the nature of the signal or feedback available to the learning system supervised learning the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs given by a teacher and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs unsupervised learning no labels are given to the learning algorithm leaving it on its own to find structure in its input unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself discovering hidden patterns in data or a means towards an end feature learning reinforcement learning a computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent as it navigates its problem space the program is provided feedback that s analogous to rewards which it tries to maximise 2 although each algorithm has advantages and limitations no single algorithm works for all problems 43 44 45 supervised learning edit main article supervised learning a support vector machine is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a linear boundary here the linear boundary divides the black circles from the white supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs 46 the data known as training data consists of a set of training examples each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output also known as a supervisory signal in the mathematical model each training example is represented by an array or vector sometimes called a feature vector and the training data is represented by a matrix through iterative optimisation of an objective function supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs 47 an optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data an algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task 15 types of supervised learning algorithms include active learning classification and regression 48 classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values while regression algorithms are used when the outputs can take any numerical value within a range for example in a classification algorithm that filters emails the input is an incoming email and the output is the folder in which to file the email in contrast regression is used for tasks such as predicting a person s height based on factors like age and genetics or forecasting future temperatures based on historical data 49 similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are it has applications in ranking recommendation systems visual identity tracking face verification and speaker verification unsupervised learning edit main article unsupervised learning see also cluster analysis unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labelled classified or categorised instead of responding to feedback unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering dimensionality reduction 4 and density estimation 50 cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets called clusters so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated for example by internal compactness or the similarity between members of the same cluster and separation the difference between clusters other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity a special type of unsupervised learning called self supervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself 51 52 dimensionality reduction edit dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables 53 in other words it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set also called the number of features most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction one of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis pca pca involves changing higher dimensional data e g 3d to a smaller space e g 2d the manifold hypothesis proposes that high dimensional data sets lie along low dimensional manifolds and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption leading to the areas of manifold learning and manifold regularisation semi supervised learning edit main article semi supervised learning semi supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning without any labelled training data and supervised learning with completely labelled training data some of the training examples are missing training labels yet many machine learning researchers have found that unlabelled data when used in conjunction with a small amount of labelled data can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy in weakly supervised learning the training labels are noisy limited or imprecise however these labels are often cheaper to obtain resulting in larger effective training sets 54 reinforcement learning edit main article reinforcement learning in reinforcement learning an agent takes actions in an environment these produce a reward and or a representation of the state which is fed back to the agent reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximise some notion of cumulative reward due to its generality the field is studied in many other disciplines such as game theory control theory operations research information theory simulation based optimisation multi agent systems swarm intelligence statistics and genetic algorithms in reinforcement learning the environment is typically represented as a markov decision process mdp many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques 55 reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the mdp and are used when exact models are infeasible reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent other types edit other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three fold categorisation and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system for example topic modelling meta learning 56 self learning edit self learning as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self learning named crossbar adaptive array caa 57 58 it gives a solution to the problem learning without any external reward by introducing emotion as an internal reward emotion is used as a state evaluation of a self learning agent the caa self learning algorithm computes in a crossbar fashion both decisions about actions and emotions feelings about consequence situations the system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion 59 the self learning algorithm updates a memory matrix w w a s such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine in situation s act a receive a consequence situation s compute emotion of being in the consequence situation v s update crossbar memory w a s w a s v s it is a system with only one input situation and only one output action or behaviour a there is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment the backpropagated value secondary reinforcement is the emotion toward the consequence situation the caa exists in two environments one is the behavioural environment where it behaves and the other is the genetic environment wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioural environment after receiving the genome species vector from the genetic environment the caa learns a goal seeking behaviour in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations 60 feature learning edit main article feature learning several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training 61 classic examples include principal component analysis and cluster analysis feature learning algorithms also called representation learning algorithms often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful often as a pre processing step before performing classification or predictions this technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data generating distribution while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution this replaces manual feature engineering and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised in supervised feature learning features are learned using labelled input data examples include artificial neural networks multilayer perceptrons and supervised dictionary learning in unsupervised feature learning features are learned with unlabelled input data examples include dictionary learning independent component analysis autoencoders matrix factorisation 62 and various forms of clustering 63 64 65 manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low dimensional sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data without reshaping them into higher dimensional vectors 66 deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation or a hierarchy of features with higher level more abstract features defined in terms of or generating lower level features it has been argued that an intelligent machine learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data 67 feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process however real world data such as images video and sensory data have not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features an alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination without relying on explicit algorithms sparse dictionary learning edit main article sparse dictionary learning sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix the method is strongly np hard and difficult to solve approximately 68 a popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the k svd algorithm sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts in classification the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs for a dictionary where each class has already been built a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image denoising the key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary but the noise cannot 69 anomaly detection edit main article anomaly detection in data mining anomaly detection also known as outlier detection is the identification of rare items events or observations that raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data 70 typically the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud a structural defect medical problems or errors in a text anomalies are referred to as outliers novelties noise deviations and exceptions 71 in particular in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection the interesting objects are often not rare but unexpected bursts of inactivity this pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object many outlier detection methods in particular unsupervised algorithms will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately instead a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro clusters formed by these patterns 72 three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist 73 unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabelled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labelled as normal and abnormal and involves training a classifier the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection semi supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behaviour from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance being generated by the model robot learning edit robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods starting from supervised learning reinforcement learning 74 75 and finally meta learning e g maml association rules edit main article association rule learning see also inductive logic programming association rule learning is a rule based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases it is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of interestingness 76 rule based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies learns or evolves rules to store manipulate or apply knowledge the defining characteristic of a rule based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilisation of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system this is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction 77 rule based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems association rule learning and artificial immune systems based on the concept of strong rules rakesh agrawal tomasz imieli ski and arun swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large scale transaction data recorded by point of sale pos systems in supermarkets 78 for example the rule o n i o n s p o t a t o e s b u r g e r displaystyle mathrm onions potatoes rightarrow mathrm burger found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together they are likely to also buy hamburger meat such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements in addition to market basket analysis association rules are employed today in application areas including web usage mining intrusion detection continuous production and bioinformatics in contrast with sequence mining association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions learning classifier systems lcs are a family of rule based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component typically a genetic algorithm with a learning component performing either supervised learning reinforcement learning or unsupervised learning they seek to identify a set of context dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner to make predictions 79 inductive logic programming ilp is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples background knowledge and hypotheses given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts an ilp system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses and not only logic programming such as functional programs inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing gordon plotkin and ehud shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting 80 81 82 shapiro built their first implementation model inference system in 1981 a prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples 83 the term inductive here refers to philosophical induction suggesting a theory to explain observed facts rather than mathematical induction proving a property for all members of a well ordered set models edit a machine learning model is a type of mathematical model that once trained on a given dataset can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data during training a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the model s internal parameters to minimise errors in its predictions 84 by extension the term model can refer to several levels of specificity from a general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all its internal parameters tuned 85 various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems picking the best model for a task is called model selection artificial neural networks edit main article artificial neural network see also deep learning an artificial neural network is an interconnected group of nodes akin to the vast network of neurons in a brain here each circular node represents an artificial neuron and an arrow represents a connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another artificial neural networks anns or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains such systems learn to perform tasks by considering examples generally without being programmed with any task specific rules an ann is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain each connection like the synapses in a biological brain can transmit information a signal from one artificial neuron to another an artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it in common ann implementations the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non linear function of the sum of its inputs the connections between artificial neurons are called edges artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds the weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold typically artificial neurons are aggregated into layers different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs signals travel from the first layer the input layer to the last layer the output layer possibly after traversing the layers multiple times the original goal of the ann approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would however over time attention moved to performing specific tasks leading to deviations from biology artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks including computer vision speech recognition machine translation social network filtering playing board and video games and medical diagnosis deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network this approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition 86 decision trees edit main article decision tree learning a decision tree showing survival probability of passengers on the titanic decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item represented in the branches to conclusions about the item s target value represented in the leaves it is one of the predictive modelling approaches used in statistics data mining and machine learning tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees in these tree structures leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values typically real numbers are called regression trees in decision analysis a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making in data mining a decision tree describes data but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making random forest regression edit random forest regression rfr falls under the umbrella of decision tree based models rfr is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and to avoid overfitting to build decision trees rfr uses bootstrapped sampling for instance each decision tree is trained on random data from the training set this random selection of rfr for training enables the model to reduce biased predictions and achieve a higher degree of accuracy rfr generates independent decision trees and it can work on single output data as well as multiple regressor tasks this makes rfr compatible to be use in various applications 87 88 support vector machines edit main article support vector machine support vector machines svms also known as support vector networks are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression given a set of training examples each marked as belonging to one of two categories an svm training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category 89 an svm training algorithm is a non probabilistic binary linear classifier although methods such as platt scaling exist to use svm in a probabilistic classification setting in addition to performing linear classification svms can efficiently perform a non linear classification using what is called the kernel trick implicitly mapping their inputs into high dimensional feature spaces regression analysis edit main article regression analysis illustration of linear regression on a data set regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features its most common form is linear regression where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares the latter is often extended by regularisation methods to mitigate overfitting and bias as in ridge regression when dealing with non linear problems go to models include polynomial regression for example used for trendline fitting in microsoft excel 90 logistic regression often used in statistical classification or even kernel regression which introduces non linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher dimensional space multivariate linear regression extends the concept of linear regression to handle multiple dependent variables simultaneously this approach estimates the relationships between a set of input variables and several output variables by fitting a multidimensional linear model it is particularly useful in scenarios where outputs are interdependent or share underlying patterns such as predicting multiple economic indicators or reconstructing images 91 which are inherently multi dimensional bayesian networks edit main article bayesian network a simple bayesian network rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet a bayesian network belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph dag for example a bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms given symptoms the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning bayesian networks that model sequences of variables like speech signals or protein sequences are called dynamic bayesian networks generalisations of bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams gaussian processes edit main article gaussian processes an example of gaussian process regression prediction compared with other regression models 92 a gaussian process is a stochastic process in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a multivariate normal distribution and it relies on a pre defined covariance function or kernel that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations given a set of observed points or input output examples the distribution of the unobserved output of a new point as a function of its input data can be directly computed by looking at the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new unobserved point gaussian processes are popular surrogate models in bayesian optimisation used to do hyperparameter optimisation genetic algorithms edit main article genetic algorithm a genetic algorithm ga is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem in machine learning genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s 93 94 conversely machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms 95 belief functions edit main article dempster shafer theory the theory of belief functions also referred to as evidence theory or dempster shafer theory is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability possibility and imprecise probability theories these theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined e g dempster s rule of combination just like how in a pmf based bayesian approach would combine probabilities 96 however there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to bayesian approaches to incorporate ignorance and uncertainty quantification these belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various ensemble methods to better handle the learner s decision boundary low samples and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving 97 6 however the computational complexity of these algorithms is dependent on the number of propositions classes and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches rule based models edit main article rule based machine learning rule based machine learning rbml is a branch of machine learning that automatically discovers and learns rules from data it provides interpretable models making it useful for decision making in fields like healthcare fraud detection and cybersecurity key rbml techniques includes learning classifier systems 98 association rule learning 99 artificial immune systems 100 and other similar models these methods extract patterns from data and evolve rules over time training models edit typically machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions when training a machine learning model machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative sample of data data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text a collection of images sensor data and data collected from individual users of a service overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model trained models derived from biased or non evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions biased models may result in detrimental outcomes thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives algorithmic bias is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams federated learning edit main article federated learning federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to train machine learning models that decentralises the training process allowing for users privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralised server this also increases efficiency by decentralising the training process to many devices for example gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to google 101 applications edit there are many applications for machine learning including agriculture anatomy adaptive website affective computing astronomy automated decision making banking behaviorism

competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10 a joint team made up of researchers from at t labs research in collaboration with the teams big chaos and pragmatic theory built an ensemble model to win the grand prize in 2009 for 1 million 105 shortly after the prize was awarded netflix realised that viewers ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns everything is a recommendation and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly 106 in 2010 an article in the wall street journal noted the use of machine learning by rebellion research to predict the 2008 financial crisis 107 in 2012 co founder of sun microsystems vinod khosla predicted that 80 of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software 108 in 2014 it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognised influences among artists 109 in 2019 springer nature published the first research book created using machine learning 110 in 2020 machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for covid 19 111 machine learning was recently applied to predict the pro environmental behaviour of travellers 112 recently machine learning technology was also applied to optimise smartphone s performance and thermal behaviour based on the user s interaction with the phone 113 114 115 when applied correctly machine learning algorithms mlas can utilise a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns without overfitting by employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts mlas can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques like ols 116 recent advancements in machine learning have extended into the field of quantum chemistry where novel algorithms now enable the prediction of solvent effects on chemical reactions thereby offering new tools for chemists to tailor experimental conditions for optimal outcomes 117 machine learning is becoming a useful tool to investigate and predict evacuation decision making in large scale and small scale disasters different solutions have been tested to predict if and when householders decide to evacuate during wildfires and hurricanes 118 119 120 other applications have been focusing on pre evacuation decisions in building fires 121 122 limitations edit although machine learning has been transformative in some fields machine learning programs often fail to deliver expected results 123 124 125 reasons for this are numerous lack of suitable data lack of access to the data data bias privacy problems badly chosen tasks and algorithms wrong tools and people lack of resources and evaluation problems 126 the black box theory poses another yet significant challenge black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted from the data 127 the house of lords select committee which claimed that such an intelligence system that could have a substantial impact on an individual s life would not be considered acceptable unless it provided a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions it makes 127 in 2018 a self driving car from uber failed to detect a pedestrian who was killed after a collision 128 attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the ibm watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested 129 130 microsoft s bing chat chatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users 131 machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature while it has improved with training sets it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research itself 132 explainability edit main article explainable artificial intelligence explainable ai xai or interpretable ai or explainable machine learning xml is artificial intelligence ai in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the ai 133 it contrasts with the black box concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an ai arrived at a specific decision 134 by refining the mental models of users of ai powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions xai promises to help users perform more effectively xai may be an implementation of the social right to explanation overfitting edit main article overfitting the blue line could be an example of overfitting a linear function due to random noise settling on a bad overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalising the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is 135 other limitations and vulnerabilities edit learners can also be disappointed by learning the wrong lesson a toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses 136 a real world example is that unlike humans current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in adversarial images that the system misclassifies 137 138 adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems or from non pattern perturbations for some systems it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel 139 machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation or evasion via adversarial machine learning 140 researchers have demonstrated how backdoors can be placed undetectably into classifying e g for categories spam and not spam of posts machine learning models that are often developed or trained by third parties parties can change the classification of any input including in cases for which a type of data software transparency is provided possibly including white box access 141 142 143 model assessments edit classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method which splits the data into a training and test set conventionally 2 3 training set and 1 3 test set designation and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set in comparison the k fold cross validation method randomly partitions the data into k subsets and then k experiments are performed each considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining k 1 subsets for training the model in addition to the holdout and cross validation methods bootstrap which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset can be used to assess model accuracy 144 in addition to overall accuracy investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning true positive rate tpr and true negative rate tnr respectively similarly investigators sometimes report the false positive rate fpr as well as the false negative rate fnr however these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators receiver operating characteristic roc along with the accompanying area under the roc curve auc offer additional tools for classification model assessment higher auc is associated with a better performing model 145 ethics edit this section is an excerpt from ethics of artificial intelligence edit the ethics of artificial intelligence covers a broad range of topics within ai that are considered to have particular ethical stakes 146 this includes algorithmic biases fairness accountability transparency privacy and regulation particularly where systems influence or automate human decision making it also covers various emerging or potential future challenges such as machine ethics how to make machines that behave ethically lethal autonomous weapon systems arms race dynamics ai safety and alignment technological unemployment ai enabled misinformation 147 how to treat certain ai systems if they have a moral status ai welfare and rights artificial superintelligence and existential risks 146 some application areas may also have particularly important ethical implications like healthcare education criminal justice or the military bias edit main article algorithmic bias different machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases a machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data when trained on human made data machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society 148 systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use algorithmic bias thus digitising cultural prejudices 149 for example in 1988 the uk s commission for racial equality found that st george s medical school had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to either be women or have non european sounding names 148 using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants 150 151 another example includes predictive policing company geolitica s predictive algorithm that resulted in disproportionately high levels of over policing in low income and minority communities after being trained with historical crime data 152 while responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning some researchers blame the lack of participation and representation of minority populations in the field of ai for machine learning s vulnerability to biases 153 in fact according to research carried out by the computing research association in 2021 female faculty make up just 16 1 of all faculty members who focus on ai among several universities around the world 154 furthermore among the group of new u s resident ai phd graduates 45 identified as white 22 4 as asian 3 2 as hispanic and 2 4 as african american which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of ai 154 language models learned from data have been shown to contain human like biases 155 156 because human languages contain biases machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases 157 158 in 2016 microsoft tested tay a chatbot that learned from twitter and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language 159 in an experiment carried out by propublica an investigative journalism organisation a machine learning algorithm s insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants 152 in 2015 google photos once tagged a couple of black people as gorillas which caused controversy the gorilla label was subsequently removed and in 2023 it still cannot recognise gorillas 160 similar issues with recognising non white people have been found in many other systems 161 because of such challenges the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains 162 concern for fairness in machine learning that is reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists including fei fei li who said that t here s nothing artificial about ai it s inspired by people it s created by people and most importantly it impacts people it is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand and that is a profound responsibility 163 financial incentives edit there are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public s interest but as income generating machines this is especially true in the united states where there is a long standing ethical dilemma of improving health care but also increasing profits for example the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm s proprietary owners hold stakes there is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals with an additional tool to diagnose medicate and plan recovery paths for patients but this requires these biases to be mitigated 164 hardware edit since the 2010s advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units 165 by 2019 graphics processing units gpus often with ai specific enhancements had displaced cpus as the dominant method of training large scale commercial cloud ai 166 openai estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from alexnet 2012 to alphazero 2017 and found a 300 000 fold increase in the amount of compute required with a doubling time trendline of 3 4 months 167 168 tensor processing units tpus edit tensor processing units tpus are specialised hardware accelerators developed by google specifically for machine learning workloads unlike general purpose gpus and fpgas tpus are optimised for tensor computations making them particularly efficient for deep learning tasks such as training and inference they are widely used in google cloud ai services and large scale machine learning models like google s deepmind alphafold and large language models tpus leverage matrix multiplication units and high bandwidth memory to accelerate computations while maintaining energy efficiency 169 since their introduction in 2016 tpus have become a key component of ai infrastructure especially in cloud based environments neuromorphic computing edit neuromorphic computing refers to a class of computing systems designed to emulate the structure and functionality of biological neural networks these systems may be implemented through software based simulations on conventional hardware or through specialised hardware architectures 170 physical neural networks edit a physical neural network is a specific type of neuromorphic hardware that relies on electrically adjustable materials such as memristors to emulate the function of neural synapses the term physical neural network highlights the use of physical hardware for computation as opposed to software based implementations it broadly refers to artificial neural networks that use materials with adjustable resistance to replicate neural synapses 171 172 embedded machine learning edit embedded machine learning is a sub field of machine learning where models are deployed on embedded systems with limited computing resources such as wearable computers edge devices and microcontrollers 173 174 175 176 running models directly on these devices eliminates the need to transfer and store data on cloud servers for further processing thereby reducing the risk of data breaches privacy leaks and theft of intellectual property personal data and business secrets embedded machine learning can be achieved through various techniques such as hardware acceleration 177 178 approximate computing 179 and model optimisation 180 181 common optimisation techniques include pruning quantisation knowledge distillation low rank factorisation network architecture search and parameter sharing software edit software suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms include the following free and
